# Peach Party Game
 
This two-player game, loosely based on the Mario Party game app, is developed in C++ and built upon principles of polymorphism and inheritance. Using a provided code skeleton, it is designed to capture player input and enable interactions between the game map and various in-game functions. This repository contains the code developed alongside the skeleton, which provides the visual elements of the game.
