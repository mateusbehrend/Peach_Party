# Peach Party
 
This two-player game, which loosely emulates the Mario Party game app, is developed in C++ and predicated on polymorphism and inheritance. Developed on a given code skeleton, it is designed to sense player input and allow for interaction between the game map and various in-game functions. This repository contains the code developed in conjunction with the code skeleton that provides the visual aspects of the game.
